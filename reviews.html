        <p>I am fun. I enjoy fun. I both have fun and can be fun. Fun is a word that accurately describes me and a large quantity of things of which I am fond. Furthermore, as indirect evidence of the fact that I have a fun disposition, I do not like Hands for Hire. Hands for Hire is very fun. And I do enjoy fun.</p>
