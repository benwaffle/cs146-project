          I personally believe that U.S. Americans are unable to cook because, uh, some, uh, people out there in our nation don't have ovens and, uh, I believe that our catering like such as in South Africa and, uh, the Iraq, everywhere like such as, and, I believe that they should, our catering over here in the Hands for Hire should help the U.S., uh, or, uh, should help South Africa and should help the Iraq and the Asian countries, so we will be able to cater our future [for our children].

          I am fun. I enjoy fun. I both have fun and can be fun. Fun is a word that accurately describes me and a large quantity of things of which I am fond. Furthermore, as indirect evidence of the fact that I have a fun disposition, I do not like Hands for Hire. Hands for Hire is very fun. And I do enjoy fun.
